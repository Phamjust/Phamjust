# Bank API Project

## Project Description
For this project I built an Expense Reimbursement API, where employees of a company are able to login and submit requests for expenses that occured on company time. Employees are able to view all their past and currently pending reimburstment requests. On the other hand, managers are able to login and see all past requests and all current pending requests from all employees. 

## Technologies Used

* Apache Maven 3.0.5
* openjdk version "1.8.0_312"
* Javalin
* Docker & Docker compose

## Features

List of features ready and TODOs for future development
